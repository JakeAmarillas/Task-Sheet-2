            <img src="Picture1.png">
            <p>An eager and ambitious computer engineering student with a strong passion for technology, possessing a genuine curiosity to explore its possibilities, and seeking to apply and expand my skills in a professional setting.</p>
            <h3>Weakness:</h3>
            <p>I am not a sociable person. I am shy and have difficulty interacting with others, especially in new situations. I tend to be hesitant to speak up and often feel self-conscious around other people. This makes it difficult for me to make friends and build relationships.</p>
            <p>I am also a procrastinator. I often put off tasks until the last minute, even when I know I have plenty of time to complete them. This can lead to stress and anxiety, and it can also impact my performance.</p>
            <p>I do not perform well under pressure. When I feel stressed or anxious, my mind tends to go blank and I have difficulty thinking clearly. This can make it difficult to complete tasks and can lead to mistakes.</p>
            <p>I am aware of my weaknesses and I am working on improving them. I am trying to be more social and to put myself in situations where I can meet new people. I am also working on managing my procrastination and developing better coping mechanisms for dealing with stress and anxiety. I know that it will take time and effort, but I am committed to becoming a better version of myself.</p>
            <h3>Strength:</h3>
            <p>I set high standards for myself and I always strive to do my best. This can be a positive quality, as it motivates me to work hard and produce high-quality work. I am also very aware of my surroundings. I am good at paying attention to my environment and I am able to pick up on subtle cues. I am a very independent person. I am good at making my own decisions and I don't like to rely on others for help. This can be a positive quality, as it makes me self-sufficient and resourceful. </p>
            <h3>Hobby:</h3>
            <p>Playing online games such as Clash of Clans and Mobile legends</p>
